## Vectra Event Collector Help

### Retrieve API Token

To authenticate this integration with Vectra, we need to generate an API token in Vectra Dashboard. 

Every user created on the Vectra platform has access to his or her API token under the **My Profile** page. The token provides access to the API based on the userâ€™s role, like UI access. Thus, if a user does not have
ability to create triage filters from the UI, that user will also not be able to create triage filters using API.
