2. Deduplicates by linking and closing similar incidents.
3. Retrieves related files from endpoints using hash / file path.
4. Hunts for occurrences of suspicious files in the organization's endpoints.
5. Unzips zipped files, and extracts indicators from them.
7. Detonates files and URLs in sandbox integrations. 
8. Calculates a severity for the incident.
9. Allows the analyst to remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators that were found.
