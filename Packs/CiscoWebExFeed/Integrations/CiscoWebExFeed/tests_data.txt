All Webex hosted services are advertised under AS13445, refer to the <a href="https://www.webex.com/peering-policy.html">Webex Peering Policy</a>. Services hosted by other service providers are not included here.  This includes TSP partner systems or our content delivery partners.  If you are connecting to partner-hosted systems such as a Partner VoIP system, please contact the partner for the appropriate IP addresses and ports.<br/><br/><b>Guidance on IPS firewall:</b>
<ul><li>Bypass firewall IPS or other types of DoS protection(allowed) for Webex traffic (defined by Webex IP CIDR blocks), especially the media traffic.</li><li>If IPS can not be a bypass, proper sizing is required to be carried out to ensure IPS have sufficient capacity to handle the audio and video throughput for a large number of participants.</li><li>If IPS can not be a bypass, proper fine-tuning of the signature and threshold has to be achieved so that Webex traffic is not misclassified and subsequently dropped.</li><li>Monitor firewall IPS alerts to investigate any IPS alert against Webex traffic.</li></ul>
Note: The following UserAgents will be passed by Webex by the utiltp process in Webex, and should be allowed through an agency's firewall:

<ul><li>UserAgent=WebexInMeetingWin</li><li>UserAgent=WebexInMeetingMac</li><li>UserAgent=prefetchDocShow</li><li>UserAgent=standby</li></ul>
<br/><b>Guidance on Proxy servers:</b>
<ul><li>The Webex meeting client does not support SNI extension for TLS media connections. Connection failure to the Webex audio and video services will occur if a proxy server requires the presence of SNI.</li></ul>
